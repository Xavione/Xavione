# Hey, I’m Xavione Gordon (aka Zaye4k)  
**Aspiring Cloud Infrastructure & Automation Engineer | IT Generalist | Lifelong Learner**

## 🎯 My Focus Now  
Training in enterprise-scale data-center operations and diving deep into **networking fundamentals, Python scripting, Terraform automation**, and cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform).  
I’m building the bridge between physical hardware know-how and virtual/cloud environments to launch into roles in **Cloud Operations, Infrastructure Support, and DevOps**.

## 🔧 Current Projects & Portfolio  
- **Infra & Automation Lab** – Building virtual lab environments, automating server and network tasks, documenting each step.  
- **DSA-Journal (Java)** – Tracking my progress through data structures & algorithms as I strengthen foundational coding skills.  
- More to come: automation scripts, cloud deployments, monitoring setups.

## 🚀 My Why  
From hands-on hardware and data-center experience to slick automation and cloud-driven systems — I want to be the engineer who *knows both ends*.  
Committed to consistent growth. One commit, one lesson, one deploy at a time.
